    <h5>as you can see from my changes in my unity version control</h5>
    <h5>not only did i manage to add a tilemap</h5>
    <h5>i also followed the tutorial far enough to write the random generation map</h5>
    <h5>as well as that i added lots of comments</h5>

    <h5>although i do not have screenshots as i have forgot to capture them as a screenshot</h5>
    <h5>i accomplished a lot on this day.</h5>
    <h5>as well as my game now generating a random 8 by 8 grid of floor tiles</h5>
    <h5>i now also have a border of seperate assets that generate a map border.</h5>
    <h5>these will be inaccesible to the player model.</h5>

    <h5>eureka! even more progress comes todayu and im thinking of recording a basic video.</h5>
    <h5>now my game is centralised completely (except a little off the top.)</h5>
    <h5>i now have a character model next will be to add a player controller.</h5>
    <h5>this also allows the model to display over the board that is generated.</h5>
